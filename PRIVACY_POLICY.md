# AutoPruner Discord Bot Privacy Policy

**1. Data Collection**

AutoPruner Discord Bot (the 'Bot') collects the following information:

- Your server ID, the ID of the channel where logs are sent (if applicable), the last time the bot executed a prune.
- All data set by the user in the bot's settings command (e.g., prune frequency).

**2. Use of Data**

The collected information is used solely for the operation of the Bot, including:

- Managing and executing member pruning based on server settings.
- Recording pruning activities in designated log channels within each server.

**3. Data Storage and Security**

All collected data is securely stored on our servers. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect data against unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction.

**4. Data Sharing**

We do not share, sell, or distribute collected data to third parties unless required by law or necessary to comply with Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.

**5. Data Retention**

We retain collected data only for as long as it is necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy (i.e., for as long as the bot is in the server). When the Bot is removed from a Discord server, all data associated with that server is immediately deleted from our servers.

**6. User Rights**

You have the right to:

- Access the information we hold about your Discord server.
- Request corrections to any inaccuracies in the data.
- Request deletion of the data collected from your server.

To exercise these rights, please contact us (see Section 8).

**7. Changes to the Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes will be posted on this page, and your continued use of the Bot after such updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
